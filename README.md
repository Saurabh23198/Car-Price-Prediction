# Car-Price-Prediction
# The Problem
The prices of new cars in the industry is fixed by the manufacturer with some additional costs incurred by the Government in the form of taxes. So, customers buying a new car can be assured of the money they invest to be worthy. But due to the increased price of new cars and the incapability of customers to buy new cars due to the lack of funds, used cars sales are on a global increase (Pal, Arora and Palakurthy, 2018). There is a need for a used car price prediction system to effectively determine the worthiness of the car using a variety of features. 
# Price Prediction Model
Based on the attributes such as Number of Year's Driven, Selling Price, Present Price, Kilometers Driven, Fuel Type, Seller Type,	Transmission Owner, the model uses the 'Random Seach CV' algorithm in order to come up the prediction. According to the model, the key features for the prediction are  Present Price, Fuel Type and Seller Type. The model uses Random Forest Regressor method to tune the hyperparameter.
